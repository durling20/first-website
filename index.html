                        <p>
                            Today we have two major candidates for president: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. 
                            These two candidates have not officially been selected for their party, 
                            however there is a high probability that they will at their 
                            respective party conventions this summer. Many Americans have 
                            expressed displeasure with these options, however we need to 
                            realize these are the options that we will ultimately be choosing
                            from.

                    <h3>The Incumbent President</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coming in at 81 years old for reelection, we have our current President: Joe Biden. 
                        He has been criticized for his old age and is currently coming in behind his opponent 
                        in the polls. He wants to grow the middle class and create policies that benefit 
                        working families. At the recent debate he was slow and extremely hard to follow only making 
                        his chances worse.

                    <h3>The Former President</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coming in at 78 years old for reelection, we have our former President: Donald Trump. 
                        He has been convicted as a felon, unsuccessfully indicted twice, and has multiple misdemeanor accounts 
                        to his name. He is critisized mainly on those accounts. His campaign promises revolve around protecting 
                        the border, gun rights, and upholding pro-life/anti-choice policy. At the recent debate he spouted 
                        many demonstrably false claims. However, he said them confidently and clearly making him the winner of 
                        the debate.
