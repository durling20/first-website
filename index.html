I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really liked adding some style to this. The hardest part for this was by far adding 
the javascript for the modal. This was because I have never done that before and I couldn't figure out where to put it or how to add it. 
Overall a fun time though!

        <h2>Poem Title</h2>
        <p>This poem is inspired by my love for a game called Magic the Gathering. It can be a frustrating game, but I always want to play more.</p>
        <div class="poem">
        I play my first spell<br><br>
        My opponent counters it<br><br>
        I will lose this game
        </div>
        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>I would like to expound on this game Magic the Gathering. This is a popular trading card game that revolves around deck building and casting spells to try and win. You can win in various ways, but the most common is to reduce your opponents life total to zero.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy playing Mario Kart. I have grown up playing this game and I think I am very good. I am sure there are better players than me, but in groups I play with, I generally come out in first. It is a nastolgic and simply great game.</p>
        <p>Another interest I have is politics. My family always manages to get into a good discussion about politics when we are together. I like hearing different perspectives and learning from people who see things different from me. </p>
